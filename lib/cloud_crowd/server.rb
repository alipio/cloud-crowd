module CloudCrowd

  # The main CloudCrowd (Sinatra) application. The actions are:
  #
  # == Admin
  # [get /] Render the admin console, with a progress meter for running jobs.
  # [get /status] Get the combined JSON of every active job and worker.
  # [get /worker/:name] Look up the details of a WorkUnit that a Worker is busy processing.
  # [get /heartbeat] Returns 200 OK to let monitoring tools know the server's up.
  #
  # == Public API
  # [post /jobs] Begin a new Job. Post with a JSON representation of the job-to-be. (see examples).
  # [get /jobs/:job_id] Check the status of a Job. Response includes output, if the Job has finished.
  # [delete /jobs/:job_id] Clean up a Job when you're done downloading the results. Removes all intermediate files.
  #
  # == Internal Workers API
  # [put /node/:host] Registers a new Node, making it available for processing.
  # [delete /node/:host] Removes a Node from the registry, freeing up any WorkUnits that it had checked out.
  # [put /work/:unit_id] Mark a finished WorkUnit as completed or failed, with results.
